<p>Three foods I thought of at the top of my head</p>
Banh Mi, Pad See Ew, and Pancit Palabok

Learned how to get path of files for including image
need to review image attributes

What I tried, trying to wrap h1 inside p as a descendant
What I learned, Don't Google html can i wrap <h1> with <p>, Instead Google can you put h1 inside p
h1 and p can only ever contain inline elements, and can only contain plaintext
h1 is not plaintext therefore it cannot go inside p
