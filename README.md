<p>Three foods I thought of at the top of my head
Banh Mi, Pad See Ew, and Pancit Palabok

Learned how to get path of files for including image
need to review image attributes</p>

<p>What I tried, trying to wrap h1 inside p as a descendant</p>
<p>What I learned, h1 and p can only ever contain inline elements, and can only contain plaintext
<p>h1 is not plaintext therefore it cannot go inside p</p>
